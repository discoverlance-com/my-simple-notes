# My Simple Notes

A fast, modern, and minimal notes app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and
[React](https://react.dev/). Supports offline usage as a Progressive Web App
(PWA) and can be deployed as a static site or containerized for platforms like
Google Cloud Run.

---

## Features

- ⚡️ **Vite + React**: Instant reloads, fast builds
- 📝 **Note-taking**: Simple, clean UI for managing notes
- 📱 **PWA**: Installable, works offline, mobile-friendly
- 🚀 **Docker-ready**: Easily deploy as a container
- ☁️ **Cloud Run compatible**: Ready for Google Cloud Run

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-simple-notes.git
cd my-simple-notes
npm install
```

### Local Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

---

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

- The app is installable and works offline.
- Make sure to build and serve the `dist` folder with a static server for full
  PWA support.

---

## Building for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist` directory.

---

## Docker Deployment

Build and run the app with Docker:

```sh
docker build -t my-simple-notes .
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-simple-notes
```

---

## Deploying to Google Cloud Run

1. Build and tag your Docker image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT-ID>/<REPO>/my-sample-notes:latest .
   ```

2. Push to Artifact Registry:

   ```sh
   docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT-ID>/<REPO>/my-sample-notes:latest
   ```

3. Deploy to Cloud Run:

   ```sh

   gcloud run deploy my-sample-notes \
     --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT-ID>/<REPO>/my-sample-notes:latest \
     --platform managed \
     --region us-central1 \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

Note: this repo includes a `cloudbuild.yaml` that builds, tests, and deploys the
image to Cloud Run using Google Cloud Build. You can also use a GitHub Actions
workflow to build and deploy, but this project keeps deployment simple by using
Cloud Build.

### Cloud Build Deployment notes

- Create a Cloud Build trigger that uses the repository and the included
  `cloudbuild.yaml` so Cloud Build runs the steps defined there on each trigger.
- Update the image repository in the commands above to your Artifact Registry
  path (for example `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/REPO`).
